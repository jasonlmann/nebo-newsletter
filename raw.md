# Nebo's back!

Dear [firstname, fallback="Friend"],

It's almost here: Nebo Lodge opens for the season on May 20th!

After a strange , windy, and occasionally warm winter on the island, spring has arrived! The daffodils are in full bloom, the cows at the farm are expecting, and the lawn is almost ready to be mowed.

And we are excited to welcome you back to Nebo! You can book your spring, summer, or fall stay at Nebo right now. And you'd better do it soon, because the rooms are already beginning to fill up.

## Turner Farm Barn Dinners
We are looking forward to our best summer yet on the farm with weekly [barn dinners](#), more intimate [farm-to-table cooking classes](#), and our [SeaFarm suppers](#)—which combine our popular barn dinners with a few extra treats from Penobscot Bay. If you're a seafood lover, don't miss it.

These are some of our most popular events of the summer, and we offer round trip transportation from Rockland. This year you can [book your tickets online]()—and they're going fast!

## Restaurant schedule
Nebo will be open for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights from May 20th to June 25th, as well as the Sunday night of Memorial Day weekend, May 29th.

We also offer an abbreviated menu to inn guests on the nights when the restaurant is closed.

Check out the full schedule on our website.

We look forward to welcoming you this summer,
