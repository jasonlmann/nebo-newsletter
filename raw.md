This spring, Nebo Lodge celebrates 10 YEARS of our restaurant! We invite all our guests, friends, and neighbors to join us for an anniversary celebration on Sunday evening of Memorial Day weekend, May 29th, from 4:30 to 6pm with complimentary oysters and appetizers on the deck and drink specials at the bar. Join us!

This week, we are putting the final touches on the gardens, menu, and inn to be ready for you this weekend&mdash;we open Friday night!

Scroll down for our opening weekend menu and a sneak peak of what the season has to offer (although, of course, our menu changes nightly). From halibut that was just caught in Penobscot Bay to our favorite North Haven Oysters to spring greens and a new fromage blanc cheese from the farm&mdash;we are celebrating the bounty of the bay and island this weekend and all season. All spring we'll be open Friday and Saturday nights, serving dinner from 5&ndash;9pm. We always welcome walk-ins at the bar and you can call or email for reservations any time!

We've got a few rooms left for inn guests this coming weekend and a special dinner deal for mid-week inn guests.

This time of year on the island is absolutely gorgeous and green.  The afternoon light and sunsets are breathtaking, town is peaceful and the roads are quiet for biking and walking, and the trees are bursting leaves and budding lilacs. It is a perfect time of year to have our seaside golf course to yourself, to kayak around the inlets and bays, or just relax on our porches. Come see us this spring!
