  		<h1>Happy spring!</h1>
  		<p>Dear [firstname,fallback=Friend],</p>
      <p>It's almost here: Nebo Lodge opens for the season on May 20th!</p>
      <p>After a strange , windy, and occasionally warm winter on the island, spring has arrived! The daffodils are in full bloom, the cows at the farm are expecting, and the lawn is almost ready to be mowed.</p>
      <p>And we are excited to welcome you back to Nebo! You can <a href="http://www.nebolodge.com/rooms">book your spring, summer, or fall stay at Nebo right now</a>. And you'd better do it soon, because the rooms are already beginning to fill up.</p>
