  		<h1>Our Spring Dine &amp; Stay Special Returns!</h1>
      <p>Have you been thinking about a trip to the island this spring? Well, now's the time to book, because <strong>Nebo's Spring Dine &amp; Stay Special is back.</strong></p>

      <p><a href="http://www.nebolodge.com/spring-dine-stay-special">Book a room any Monday&ndash;Thursday night between May 23rd and June 23rd</a> and get <strong>$50 off dinner for two at Nebo.</strong> Flying solo? Enjoy $25 off dinner for one.</p>

      <p class="fineprint"><em>Fineprint: This offer has no cash value and is good for one dinner only in the restaurant during your stay.</em></p>

      <p>Spring is one of our favorite times of year: "mud season" is over, the island has exploded in bright greens contrasted by the gorgeous pinks and purples of our native lupine, our thirty miles of bicycle-friendly roads are still quiet&mdash;and the beaches are yours alone to explore.</p>

      <p>Ready to join us?</p>

      <h2>Prefer the fall?</h2>
      <p>If your spring is as busy as that of many Mainers, not to worry...our Dine &amp; Stay Special is available in the fall too! Inn guests who visit us after Labor Day get the same $50 off dinner in our restaurant!</p>
      <p>Either way, Nebo Lodge makes it easy for you to get away during the beautiful weeks of late spring and early fall&mdash;which are, as we all know, Maineâ€™s best-kept secrets!</p>

      <p>See you soon!<br />
