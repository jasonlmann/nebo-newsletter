      <h1>It's spring!</h1>
      <p>Dear [firstname,fallback=Friend],</p>
      <p>Bud by bud, blade by blade, the earth is slowly reawakening on North Haven, each burst of color heralding the arrival of spring! Thanks to the warm cover provided by its heated greenhouses, <a href="https://www.turner-farm.com">Turner Farm</a> has
        been providing delicious tender greens and other vegetables to island residents all winter long. Nebo Lodge will feature the farm's fresh, island-grown vegetables over Memorial Day Weekend, when we will open our doors for our 13th season!</p>
      <p>There are many ways you can join us to kick off the season. Choose the one (or two) that's right for you!</p>

      <h3>Spend the Night at the Inn</h3>
      <p>June is one of the most beautiful months of the year on North Haven, when the fields turn a rich lavender with the blossoming of lupines and you can smell the rich, fertile earth. The longest days of the year allow you to take a hike to the top
        of Ames Knob to watch the sunset after dinner.</p>
      <p>Get away for a weekend before the ferry gets crowded and the roads are still empty and perfect for long, leisurely bike rides. For more information, just give us a call at 207-867-2007 or email us at <a href="mailto:info@nebolodge.com">info@nebolodge.com</a>—or
        book online any time!</p>
