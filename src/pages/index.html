      <h2>Don’t want to spend the night? Come by sea!</h2>
      <p>All spring, our charter boat, the Equinox, will be making <a href="http://www.nebolodge.com/round-trip-dinner-cruise/">Saturday night trips to and from North Haven</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>That includes this Saturday, May 28th! Call to reserve your place today.</strong></p>
      <p>Trips leave Rockland at 4p.m. sharp and return by about 9p.m.&mdash;more than enough time for a cocktail on the deck and a relaxed dinner in the restaurant. And you get to ride home across the bay under the stars!</p>
      <p>The boat will make nightly runs this summer, Tuesday&ndash;Saturday nights for both Nebo dinners and <a href="http://www.nebolodge.com/barn-suppers/">Turner Farm barn dinners</a>.
      <p>The boat can only hold 25 people, so make a reservation today:</p>
